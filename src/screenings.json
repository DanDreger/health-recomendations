Those visits tend to be short and focus just on the urgent problem. A wellness visit is different — it’s a way to check in with your primary care doctor, talk about your health in a more general way, and get the preventive care you might need."

The American Cancer Society (ACS) predicts that nearly 13,000 women in the US will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2015, and more than 4,000 will die of the disease. Early detection is important because cervical cancer can often be treated with more success if it’s caught at an early stage. According to the ACS, wide use of Pap tests over the last 30 years is the main reason why the death rate for the disease has been cut in half over that time."
